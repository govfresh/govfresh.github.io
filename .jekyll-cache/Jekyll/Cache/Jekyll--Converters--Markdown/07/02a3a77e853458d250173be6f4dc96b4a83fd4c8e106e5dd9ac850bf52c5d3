I"˜<p><a href="https://opendataday.org">Open Data Day</a> is an annual event where government data enthusiasts â€“ from public sector data professinals to civic hackers â€“ get together and learn from and play with data.</p>

<h2 id="overhaul-datagov">Overhaul Data.gov</h2>

<p><a href="https://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, the central repository for official government data and is managed by the U.S. General Services Administration. While GSA doesnâ€™t have enforcement authority over agency open data publishing, it does play a major role in projecting the health of the federal governmentâ€™s open data efforts.</p>

<p>Since its inception, Data.gov has changed very little, both on the technical and user experience fronts.</p>

<p>All gov CDOs need to create an open community of practice that includes the general public.</p>

<h2 id="open-data-day-2023">Open Data Day 2023</h2>

<p>My hope is that those responsible for or serious about government data will think holistically about how we manage and publish government data. Open data is much like accessibility or security. We bake it into our processes, and itâ€™s not an afterthought. If your role is data in government, and youâ€™re not baking open data into it, then youâ€™re only doing half your job.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing how things progress before Open Data Day 2023.</p>
