I"æ<p>As part of Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äôs 2021-22 budget, the California Department of Technology has received $25 million ‚Äúto demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services.‚Äù</p>

<p>The resourcing is round two of the state‚Äôs <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">technology modernization fund</a> and is available only to state entities.</p>

<p>From the TMF website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TMF was established to make immediate investments in IT that will yield quick and meaningful results for the people of California. CDT invites California state departments or entities to submit business challenges that require an IT solution to modernize government and improve digital services for California residents and state employees. This will enable departments to deliver timely business modernization wins through a high-value proof of concept, fulfill an immediate need, and optimize services for digital government. A strong commitment from the department‚Äôs business and IT leadership and team capability are required to be successful.</p>

<p>‚ÄúInnovation and speed are terms that are too rarely applied in government,‚Äù <a href="https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2022/03/technology-modernization-fund-tmf-round-two-now-open/">said</a> the CDT when announcing the new round of funding.</p>

<h2 id="california-alpha">California Alpha</h2>

<p>In 2019, I was fortunate enough to be part of the small team tasked with re-imagining what California digital services could look like if re-imagined within the context of an open, agile and human-centered ethos.</p>

<p>Known as <a href="https://alpha.ca.gov/">Alpha</a>, the project was the precursor to what is now the <a href="https://digital.ca.gov/">California Office of Digital Innovation</a>.</p>

<p>The If you talk to the leaders of California‚Äôs pandemic digital response team, you‚Äôll find the work and lessons learned from Alpha played a highly impactful role in successfully launching and building the COVID website.</p>

<p>Those lessons are also showing up elsewhere, from the state‚Äôs new <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/">cannabis portal</a> to the new <a href="https://govfresh.com/radar/california-design-system-beta">California Web Design System</a>.</p>

<p>Alpha and COVID product manager Angelica Quirarte <a href="https://www.govtech.com/gov-experience/californias-alpha-team-takes-on-real-time-gov-redesign.html">told</a> Government Technology at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI think it also introduces a different way of civic engagement. How does the public now know what government does to deliver their work? The fact that you can have a member of the public add a task or ask us a question and literally see us work as we‚Äôre moving through the process, it‚Äôs just not something that‚Äôs very common in government. It‚Äôs not a relationship that they public is probably used to. I‚Äôm really excited to see many more comments come through.‚Äù</p>

<p>And Newsom</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this very much as a much broader effort than just CA.gov. This is really helping with the foundation of how [the Office of Digital Innovation (ODI) will operate and how we should be thinking about doing other things.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="the-25-million-question">The $25 million question</h2>
<p>During the Alpha project‚Äôs send-off event, the state‚Äôs technology leaders heard presentations by Alpha team members on how it was executed and the lessons learned.</p>

<p>At the end of the presentations, there was a question and answer session. An agency chief information officer raised his hand and asked, ‚ÄúHow do we scale this across all California agencies?‚Äù</p>

<p>He asked the $25 million question.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the state already has its answer.</p>

<p>If California is going to get a return on investment from that $25 million, it will be in</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Projects must have clear, concrete goals, a viable and quick path to delivery, and strong support from the requesting entity‚Äôs executive leadership.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated based on their probability of success, replicability, and support of statewide goals.</p>
