I"ù<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, itâ€™s a platform that allows for anyone â€“ individuals or organizations â€“ to freely publish articles for public consumption.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental problems with government agencies using Medium as a publishing platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content is paywalled after a limited number of article views.</li>
  <li>Mediumâ€™s accessibility conformance is dismal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public access to government information should never be limited by the need for a credit card. Medium should exempt all content from public sector organizations from the paywall criteria so that the general public has free, unlimited access.</p>

<p>The larger issue related to government agencies publishing information to Medium is that itâ€™s commitment to digital access is terrible. <a href="https://sheribyrnehaber.medium.com/an-accessibility-review-of-the-new-medium-site-d93e93fae3a1">accessibility review of Medium</a></p>

<p>Surprisingly, the federal governmentâ€™s primary digital service organization â€“ the U.S. Digital Service â€“ hosts <a href="https://usdigitalservice.medium.com/">its blog on Medium</a>.</p>

<p>Other government agencies do the same â€“ the <a href="https://medium.com/san-francisco-digital-services">San Francisco Digital Services</a>, <a href="https://coloradodigitalservice.medium.com/">Colorado Digital Service</a> <a href="https://medium.com/massgovdigital">Massaccutts Digital Service</a>, to name just a few. And this doesnâ€™t include individual civic technologists who pen their thoughts on digital government technology.</p>

<p>For agencies whose missions include statements it is â€œto deliver better government services to the American people through technology and designâ€ and an administration that aims to more inclusive, itâ€™s .</p>

<p>For USDS and all government agencies , itâ€™s to migrate back to your main .gov domains. If you donâ€™t, weâ€™ll know who they really intend their message for â€“ and who they donâ€™t.</p>
