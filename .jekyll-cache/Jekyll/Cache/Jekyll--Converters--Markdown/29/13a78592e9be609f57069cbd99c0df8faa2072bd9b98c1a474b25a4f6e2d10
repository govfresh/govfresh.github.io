I"å<p>As part of Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äôs 2021-22 budget, the California Department of Technology has received $25 million ‚Äúto demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services.‚Äù</p>

<p>From the state‚Äôs <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">technology modernization fund</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TMF was established to make immediate investments in IT that will yield quick and meaningful results for the people of California. CDT invites California state departments or entities to submit business challenges that require an IT solution to modernize government and improve digital services for California residents and state employees. This will enable departments to deliver timely business modernization wins through a high-value proof of concept, fulfill an immediate need, and optimize services for digital government. A strong commitment from the department‚Äôs business and IT leadership and team capability are required to be successful.</p>

<h2 id="california-alpha">California Alpha</h2>

<p>In 2019, I was fortunate enough to be part of the small team tasked with re-imagining what California digital services could look like when grounded in open, agile, human-centered principles. Known as <a href="https://alpha.ca.gov/">Alpha</a>, the project was the precursor to what is now the <a href="https://digital.ca.gov/">California Office of Digital Innovation</a>.</p>

<p>And the experience of that three-month project still lives within the DNA of every member of the Alpha team.</p>

<p>If you talk to the leaders of California‚Äôs pandemic digital response team, you‚Äôll find the work and lessons learned from Alpha played a highly impactful role in successfully launching and building the COVID website.</p>

<p>Those lessons are also showing up elsewhere, from the state‚Äôs new <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/">cannabis portal</a> to the new <a href="https://govfresh.com/radar/california-design-system-beta">California Web Design System</a>.</p>

<p>Alpha and COVID leader Angelica Quirarte <a href="https://www.govtech.com/gov-experience/californias-alpha-team-takes-on-real-time-gov-redesign.html">told</a> Government Technology at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI think it also introduces a different way of civic engagement. How does the public now know what government does to deliver their work? The fact that you can have a member of the public add a task or ask us a question and literally see us work as we‚Äôre moving through the process, it‚Äôs just not something that‚Äôs very common in government. It‚Äôs not a relationship that they public is probably used to. I‚Äôm really excited to see many more comments come through.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Michael Wilkening, then special adviser on Innovation and Digital Services in the Office of the Governor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this very much as a much broader effort than just CA.gov. This is really helping with the foundation of how [the Office of Digital Innovation [ODI] will operate and how we should be thinking about doing other things. ‚Ä¶ This is part of that overall reconceptualization and reinvigorating the relationship between Californians and their government and rebasing it. CA.gov should really be an embodiment of what that relationship looks like and it should be the place where people come to find out about California government, where they come to find out about services, how they access those services, ultimately it should be the place where they‚Äôre coming to apply for those sorts of benefits.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="californias-next-alpha">California‚Äôs next Alpha</h2>

<p>Aside from a few government technology trade press articles, Alpha‚Äôs work remains mostly a footnote. As it morphed into ODI, despite having an amazing team, it has yet to find its place within the state‚Äôs innovation ecosystem.</p>

<p>Alpha‚Äôs culture, tools, technology and systems thinking approach to operations is something California‚Äôs TMF should adopt if it‚Äôs going to realize a return on investment.</p>

<p>Alpha can scale and revolutionize how we deliver digital government services to the people of California.</p>

<p>Hopefully, there‚Äôs at least one state entity who will use that funding and be the next Alpha.</p>

<h2 id="the-25-million-answer">The $25 million answer</h2>

<p>During the Alpha project‚Äôs send-off event, the state‚Äôs technology leaders heard presentations by Alpha team members on how it was executed, lessons learned and the potential going forward.</p>

<p>At the end of the presentations, there was a question and answer session. An agency chief information officer raised his hand and asked, ‚ÄúHow do we scale this across all California agencies?‚Äù</p>

<p>He asked the $25 million question.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the state already has its answer.</p>

<p><em>Note: As a California resident, I‚Äôm open to supporting the flow of ideas that will help get the state‚Äôs ROI on this funding. If you are with a state entity and would like to discuss my thoughts on how you can leverage the energy created from the Alpha project, feel free to <a href="https://lukefretwell.com/calendar">schedule time with me here</a>.</em></p>
