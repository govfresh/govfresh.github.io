I"’<p>As part of the Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äôs 2021-22 budget, the California Department of Technology has received $25 million in funding ‚Äúto demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services.‚Äù</p>

<p>The resourcing is part of round two of the <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">CDT technology modernization fund</a> and is available only to state entities.</p>

<p>From the  CDT <a href="https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2022/03/technology-modernization-fund-tmf-round-two-now-open/">blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innovation and speed are terms that are too rarely applied in government. The TMF works to proactively invest in projects that modernize digital services for residents and state employees. Since its launch, the TMF has delivered quick results ‚Äì four projects received immediate funding to kickstart improvements that directly benefit Californians.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Projects must have clear, concrete goals, a viable and quick path to delivery, and strong support from the requesting entity‚Äôs executive leadership.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated based on their probability of success, replicability, and support of statewide goals.</p>
