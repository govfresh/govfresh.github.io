I"–<p>Iâ€™m a huge proponent that all government websites should end with the .gov extension. There are thousands of local government websites that should be leveraging the U.S. governmentâ€™s <a href="https://dotgov.gov">DotGov</a> domain name services that currently donâ€™t.</p>

<p>The implications are that itâ€™s difficult for the public to validate whether a website is official or not. At <a href="https://proudcity.com">ProudCity</a>, weâ€™ve heard numerous stories of rogue websites created by community members that appear to be official, but are not.</p>

<p>Much like the HTTPS protocol, which verifies that a website is encrypted, we must build a standard that validates a website is officially operated by a government entity. While there is a role that browsers play, universal adoption of the .gov extension is fundamental to this.</p>

<p>The good news is that weâ€™re hearing thereâ€™s an increased demand for DotGov services. But, given the volume of government websites that need to adopt .gov domains, we still need increased advocacy and an overall inviting user experience.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always felt the DotGov program could be less bureacratic in its presentation and make a more welcoming and compelling case for its adoption.</p>

<p>As we did with the <a href="/thoughts/coding-covid-dashboard">COVID dashboard</a>, my son and I built an <a href="https://dotgov.govfresh.com">alternative DotGov digital front door</a> that attempts to do just this.  To experiment with a different approach, he created a .gov domain look-up tool that pulls from the <a href="https://home.dotgov.gov/data/">data provided by DotGov</a>, and I wrote copy and designed a simple page to to accompany this.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is an inspiration to those who manage the DotGov service that we can .</p>

<p>If you are responsible for an official government website, <a href="https://dotgov.govfresh.com">itâ€™s time to go .gov</a>.</p>
