I"œ<p>Iâ€™m a huge proponent that all government websites should end with the .gov extension. There are thousands of local government websites that should be leveraging the U.S. governmentâ€™s <a href="https://dotgov.gov">DotGov</a> domain name services that currently donâ€™t.</p>

<p>If you are responsible for an official government website, <a href="https://dotgov.govfresh.com">itâ€™s time to go .gov</a>.</p>
