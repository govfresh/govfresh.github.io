I"<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, itâ€™s a platform that lets anyone â€“ individuals or organizations â€“ to freely publish articles for public consumption.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental problems with government agencies using Medium as a publishing platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content is paywalled after a limited number of article views.</li>
  <li>Mediumâ€™s accessibility conformance is dismal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once readers exceed their viewing limit on Medium, they receive this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is your last free member-only story this month. Upgrade for unlimited access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Public access to government information should never be limited by the need for a credit card. Medium should exempt all content created by public sector organizations from the paywall criteria so that the general public has free, unlimited access. Granted, Medium is a corporate entity and has to make a profit, but it should consider government gratis as its civic duty, especially in an age of rampant misinformation.</p>

<p>The larger issue related to governments publishing information to Medium is that its commitment to digital access is terrible. Disability advocate Sheri Byrne-Haber has published a <a href="https://sheribyrnehaber.medium.com/an-accessibility-review-of-the-new-medium-site-d93e93fae3a1">blistering review of Mediumâ€™s accessibility</a> which should give all government organizations pause.</p>

<p>Byrne-Haber writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAs an assistive technology user, the experience is just flat-out awful, bordering on some of the worst I have ever seen. This is an even stronger statement when you remember Iâ€™ve seen some pretty atrocious experiences in my eighteen years working in disability inclusion and accessibility.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprisingly, many digital government agencies and civic technologists host their blogs or post articles to Medium.</p>

<p>The federal governmentâ€™s primary digital service organization â€“ the U.S. Digital Service â€“ hosts <a href="https://usdigitalservice.medium.com/">its blog on Medium</a>. For an agency whose mission is â€œto deliver better government services to the American people through technology and designâ€ and an administration that aims to more inclusive, its disuse of Medium is something that should be included in.</p>

<p>Other government agencies do the same â€“ the <a href="https://medium.com/san-francisco-digital-services">San Francisco Digital Services</a>, <a href="https://coloradodigitalservice.medium.com/">Colorado Digital Service</a> <a href="https://medium.com/massgovdigital">Massaccutts Digital Service</a>, to name just a few.</p>

<p>If you are a government agency, especially one whose mission is focused on digital access, itâ€™s time to reconsider your use of Medium. If you donâ€™t, itâ€™s apparent who you really intend your message for â€“ and who you donâ€™t.</p>
