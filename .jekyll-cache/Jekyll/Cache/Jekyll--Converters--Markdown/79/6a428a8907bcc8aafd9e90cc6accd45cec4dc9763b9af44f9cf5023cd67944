I"‹<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, itâ€™s a platform that allows for anyone â€“ individuals or organizations â€“ to freely publish articles for public consumption.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental problems with government agencies using Medium as a publishing platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content is paywalled after a certain number of article views.</li>
  <li>Mediumâ€™s accessibility conformance is dismal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public access to government information should never be limited by the need for a credit card. Medium should work with public sector organizations to exempt them from the paywall.</p>

<p>The larger issue related to government agencies publishing information to Medium is that itâ€™s commitment to digital access is terrible. <a href=""></a></p>

<p>For USDS and all government agencies , itâ€™s to migrate back to your main .gov domains. If you donâ€™t, weâ€™ll know who they really intend their message for â€“ and who they donâ€™t.</p>
