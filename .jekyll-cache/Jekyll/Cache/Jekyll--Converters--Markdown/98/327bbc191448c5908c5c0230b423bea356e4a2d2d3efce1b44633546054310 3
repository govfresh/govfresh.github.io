I"Ì<p>The true story of the most devastating act of cyberwarfare in history and the desperate hunt to identify and track the elite Russian agents behind it: [A] chilling account of a Kremlin-led cyberattack, a new front in global conflict (Financial Times).</p>

<p>In 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the worldâ€™s largest businessesâ€“from drug manufacturers to software developers to shipping companies. At the attackâ€™s epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damageâ€“the largest, most destructive cyberattack the world had ever seen.</p>

<p>The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in history: a group known as Sandworm. Working in the service of Russiaâ€™s military intelligence agency, they represent a persistent, highly skilled force, one whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries. They target government and private sector, military and civilians alike.</p>

<p>A chilling, globe-spanning detective story, Sandworm considers the danger this force poses to our national security and stability. As the Kremlinâ€™s role in foreign government manipulation comes into greater focus, Sandworm exposes the realities not just of Russiaâ€™s global digital offensive, but of an era where warfare ceases to be waged on the battlefield. It reveals how the lines between digital and physical conflict, between wartime and peacetime, have begun to blurâ€“with world-shaking implications.</p>
