I"ü<p>The civic technology community has sadly lost one of its own: Kevin Joseph Walsh.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 12, Kev was <a href="https://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/news/local-news/friends-and-family-mourn-death-of-man-killed-while-walking-in-eugenia">struck and killed by a car</a> while walking with his partner and friends.</p>

<p>Kev was consistently calm, humble and good natured. A complete listener, he was fully present in every conversation. He was equally and genuinely kind to everyone.</p>

<p>In his craft â€” civic design â€” Kev was thoughtful, articulate and impactful. He was a mentor and inspiration, always leading from behind. His work in civic and government service design contributed deeply to the world we all want for our future.</p>

<p>Kev, I will always cherish your witty banter that left me crying with laughter â€” precious moments of joy you gave me that I will carry forever. Iâ€™m grateful to have shared a little bit of time with you. Iâ€™m honored to have witnessed your authenticity and unconditional support for others.</p>

<p>The  impression you left â€” on me and so many others â€” will forever be remembered with love and gratitude.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund">memorial fund</a> has been established to support Kevâ€™s family â€” his partner and two daughters. If you are a member of the civic technology community, whether you knew Kev or not, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund">donate</a>.</p>
