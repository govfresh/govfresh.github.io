I"Ñ<p>At the beginning of 2022, the U.S. Chief Data Officers Council <a href="/radar/cdo-council-2021-playbook">published a playbook</a> to help CDOs ‚Äúlead data-driven transformation‚Äù within their agencies.</p>

<p>What struck me as odd ‚Äì especially coming from an organization that should always default to an open, data-driven approach to everything it does ‚Äì was that the playbook itself came in only one format: A very unstructured, inaccessible, proprietary PDF.</p>

<p>Disappointed by this, I built a <a href="https://cdoplaybook.govfresh.com">web-based version</a> (<a href="https://github.com/govfresh/cdo-playbook">repository</a>) to make it more accessible to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-to-the-cdo-council">Recommendations to the CDO Council</h2>

<p>In the future, I hope the CDO Council ‚Äì and every government agency ‚Äì publishes information like this in open, accessible and, ideally, machine-readable formats. My hope is that <a href="https://cdoplaybook.govfresh.com">my version of the CDO playbook</a>, while not perfect, is an example of how to do this.</p>

<p>I also would like to see the CDO Council add RSS functionality to its website (as a data-driven approach to sharing updates). While a seemingly trivial point, the federal government desperately needs a simple, standard strategy for publishing information, particularly blogs and news, in a more API-like format.</p>

<p>Other suggestions for the CDO Council:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the playbook to a public repository, as a living document that others can re-purpose or contribute to (similar to the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">Digital Services Playbook</a>).</li>
  <li>Add a fifth play focused on privacy/security.</li>
  <li>Strongly recommend all federal agencies have an RSS strategy.</li>
  <li>Strongly recommend an end to government use of PDFs (unless they are accompanied by an open alternative).</li>
</ul>
