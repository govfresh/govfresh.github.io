Getting this error when building a jekyll-based website in GitHub Pages.

This appears to be Jekyll build log output rather than an error. The log shows Jekyll is successfully reading and processing your blog posts from the _posts directory. The "Error:" at the beginning seems to be a misleading label - what follows is actually normal Jekyll build output showing:

    Configuration loading: Jekyll is loading your _config.yml file
    Plugin loading: All the GitHub Pages plugins are being required successfully
    Build process: Jekyll is reading through your blog posts (all from 2011, covering topics like SF government, open data, and civic technology)

The build appears to be progressing normally. However, if you're experiencing an actual build failure, here are some things to check:

Common Jekyll/GitHub Pages issues:

    Check if the build completes successfully or stops at some point
    Look for any actual error messages after this log output
    Verify your _config.yml syntax is valid
    Ensure all required front matter is present in your posts
    Check for any plugins that aren't supported by GitHub Pages

To get more specific help:

    Share the complete build log if there are actual error messages
    Check your GitHub Pages build status in your repository's Settings > Pages
    Look at the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for detailed build logs

If the build is actually completing successfully, then this log output is normal and your site should be building fine. The "Error:" label at the start might just be how your build system is outputting the Jekyll logs.

clean up config syntax:

Looking at your Jekyll configuration file, I can see several syntax issues that need to be cleaned up. Here's the corrected version:

Key fixes made:

    Removed empty theme: line - This was causing a syntax error
    Fixed permalink paths - Added missing leading slashes for consistency:
        labs/:title → /labs/:title
        papers/:title → /papers/:title
        people/:title → /people/:title
        topics/:title → /topics/:title
        :title → /:title (for pages)
    Fixed YAML list formatting in the order section - Removed the empty list item that had no name: key

The main issue was the empty theme: line which would cause Jekyll to fail parsing the configuration. The permalink inconsistencies could also cause routing issues, so I've standardized them all to use leading slashes.

Suggestions for other files to add to:

# Exclude exclude:

Here are common files and directories to add to your Jekyll exclude: section:

Categories of files to consider excluding:

Essential additions:

    README.md - Usually not needed on the live site
    LICENSE - Legal file, not site content
    node_modules/ - If using any Node.js tools
    vendor/ - Bundler installs gems here
    .jekyll-cache/ - Jekyll's build cache

Development files:

    package.json / yarn.lock - Node.js dependencies
    gulpfile.js / webpack.config.js - Build tools
    .vscode/ / .idea/ - IDE configurations

Version control:

    .git/ / .gitignore - Git files
    .github/ - GitHub Actions/templates

Testing and docs:

    test/ / spec/ - Test files
    docs/ - Development documentation

You don't need to include all of these - just add the ones relevant to your project. The most commonly needed additions are README.md, LICENSE, node_modules/, vendor/, and .jekyll-cache/.

Error: The github-pages gem can't satisfy your Gemfile's dependencies. If you want to use a different Jekyll version or need additional dependencies, consider building Jekyll site with GitHub Actions: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/

This error occurs when your Gemfile has dependency conflicts with the versions that GitHub Pages supports. GitHub Pages uses specific, locked versions of Jekyll and plugins that may not match what's in your Gemfile.

Here are the solutions:
Option 1: Fix Gemfile for GitHub Pages (Recommended)

Create or update your Gemfile to be compatible with GitHub Pages:
Option 2: Minimal Gemfile

If you want the absolute minimal setup:
Option 3: GitHub Actions (Advanced)

If you need more control or newer Jekyll versions, use GitHub Actions instead of GitHub Pages' built-in Jekyll processing.

Steps to fix:

    Replace your current Gemfile with one of the versions above
    Delete Gemfile.lock if it exists
    Remove any Jekyll version specifications from your _config.yml
    Commit and push the changes

Common issues that cause this error:

    Specifying a Jekyll version newer than what GitHub Pages supports
    Including gems not supported by GitHub Pages
    Having conflicting version requirements

What GitHub Pages currently supports:

    Jekyll ~3.10.0 (as shown in your build log)
    Specific versions of plugins only
    Limited gem set for security

The github-pages gem automatically pulls in all the correct versions that GitHub Pages uses, ensuring compatibility.

Add option 1 to this:

source "https://rubygems.org"
# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run bundle install. Run Jekyll with bundle exec, like so:
#
# bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.0"
# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
# gem "minima", "~> 2.5"
# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run bundle update github-pages.
# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
 gem "jekyll-feed", ">= 0.15.1"
 gem "jekyll-sitemap"
 gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
 gem "jekyll-paginate"
 gem "jekyll-redirect-from"
 gem 'logger'
 gem 'csv'
 gem 'ostruct'
 gem 'base64'
 gem 'bigdecimal'
end
# Windows and JRuby do not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# and associated library.
platforms :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin, :jruby do
 gem "tzinfo", "~> 1.2"
 gem "tzinfo-data"
end
# Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", platforms: [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]
gem "webrick"

Key changes made:

    Commented out Jekyll version specification - GitHub Pages controls the Jekyll version
    Activated the github-pages gem - This ensures compatibility with GitHub Pages
    Removed duplicate plugin specifications - The github-pages gem automatically includes the correct versions of:
        jekyll-feed
        jekyll-sitemap
        jekyll-seo-tag
        jekyll-paginate
        jekyll-redirect-from
    Kept the Ruby 3.0+ compatibility gems - These are still needed for local development
    Added explanatory comments about why plugins are removed

After making this change:

    Delete your Gemfile.lock file
    Run bundle install
    Commit and push to GitHub

This will resolve the dependency conflict because the github-pages gem ensures you're using exactly the same versions that GitHub Pages uses in production.

Getting this: The github-pages gem can't satisfy your Gemfile's dependencies. If you want to use a different Jekyll version or need additional dependencies, consider building Jekyll site with GitHub Actions: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/

The error persists because the github-pages gem has strict version requirements that conflict with the additional gems you have. Let's try a different approach:

If that still doesn't work, try this minimal approach:

Troubleshooting steps:

    Try the updated Gemfile first (removed Ruby 3.0+ gems from jekyll_plugins group)
    If that fails, use the ultra-minimal version and remove all the Ruby 3.0+ compatibility gems
    Clean everything:

    bash

    rm Gemfile.lock
    bundle clean --force
    bundle install

    Check Ruby version:

    bash

    ruby --version
    ``
