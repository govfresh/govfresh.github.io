In *Hack to the Future: How World Governments Relentlessly Pursue and Domesticate Hackers*, Emily Crose offers a cultural, historical and legal schooling on hackers, hacking, and government’s evolving approach to dealing with them.

Crose dives deep into the personalities (the Kevins and Cliff Stoll—my favorite), the organizations (Cult of the Dead Cow, Anonymous, LulzSec), and the gatherings (DEF CON).

The relationship between hackers and the government has evolved over the decades. Laws—from the Comprehensive Crime Control Act to the PATRIOT are passed to keep up with the times. Acronym agencies are created to counter the increasing volume and variety (the FBI consistently seems to drop the ball).

Over the years, the relationship between hackers and the government has shifted from combative to somewhat congenial, but ... it’s complicated.

*Hack to the Future* is a master class in hacking history. Crose, with her technical chops and intelligence experience, is the perfect professor.
