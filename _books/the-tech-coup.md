*"The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley"* is a holistic take on how unprincipled, unfettered technology is eroding democracy. Marietje Schaake provides a blueprint for what we can do about it.

Schaake's government experience as a European Parliament member and her proximity to Silicon Valley—as the international director of policy at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a fellow at the university’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence—make her perspective one to note. She sees the digital forest for the trees.

The problem: Technology giants and authoritarian regimes, both leveraging monopolies of their own kind, fail to take privacy, security, and democratic principles seriously.

The solution: Upholding fundamental values of openness, transparency, accountability, security, and privacy—across technology and procurement—while advancing a "public stack" and digital public infrastructure, with governments leveraging their purchasing power to drive change.

Global values and policy initiatives, such as those outlined in the [Declaration for the Future of the Internet](/research/declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet), can guide us.

With core principles and a plan, the attempt can be resisted.
