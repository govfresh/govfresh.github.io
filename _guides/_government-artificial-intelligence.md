## Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights

The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a set of five principles and practices to guide the design and use of automated systems, safeguarding the rights of the American public in the era of artificial intelligence. Developed with input from the public, these principles aim to ensure that automated systems align with democratic values, protecting civil rights, liberties, and privacy. The Blueprint includes a Foreword, the five principles, guidance on applying them, and practical steps for various organizations to uphold these values. It serves as a national statement and toolkit, applicable across sectors, providing guidance where existing laws may be lacking. It informs policy decisions when current laws or policies don't address the responsible use of automated systems.

## National AI Advisory Committee

[National AI Advisory Committee](https://ai.gov/naiac/)

The National AI Advisory Committee (NAIAC) was established under the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 in the United States. Functioning as an advisory body, the NAIAC provides guidance to the President and the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office on matters related to the initiative's goals. These goals include maintaining U.S. leadership in AI, advancing trustworthy AI systems, preparing the workforce for AI integration, and coordinating AI activities across sectors. The committee, composed of members with diverse expertise, submits regular reports to Congress, detailing findings and recommendations on various aspects of AI development, including competitiveness, workforce impact, ethical considerations, and international collaboration. Supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the NAIAC plays a crucial role in shaping the direction of AI initiatives in the United States.

The [charter](https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NAIAC-Charter.pdf) outlines the establishment and responsibilities of the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC) by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Key points include advising on AI initiatives, reporting findings to the President and Congress, and operating under the oversight of the Secretary of Commerce. The Committee's duties encompass assessing U.S. leadership in AI, progress in AI workforce preparation, and societal impacts. It will meet at least twice a year, with support from the the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology. The charter is effective for three years, subject to renewal or termination.
