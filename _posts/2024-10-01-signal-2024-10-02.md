* "Its goal is for governments to adopt the Global Digital Compact at the Summit.”
* “One of the Global Digital Compact’s key commitments is to increase funding for Digital Public Goods (DPGs), that means open source software, open standards, open data, open AI systems, and open content collections that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals.”
* “To help developers connect with these projects, we have launched the For Good First Issue where developers can easily find and contribute to open source projects that support SDGs.”
* “This is a great place to start working together with public sector-led open source projects, without having to be a public policy geek.”

* “there isn’t a lot of actual hacking going on, unlike the hackathons I’ve attended at universities, tech companies, or ‘crisis camps‘ from a decade ago”
* “the Congressional hackathon has instead evolved into a hybrid event featuring speeches from Congressional leaders and House administrative staff, followed by panel discussions, pitches and presentations from staffers or external developers and students, breakout groups that brainstorm ideas that could help Congress work better, and then development over the course of the year to follow”

## Discord + COVID vaccines 💉

Patrick McKenzie [talks with the Dwarkesh Podcast](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/patrick-mckenzie) about how hackers on Discord helped thousands of people get COVID vaccines.



* “At the start, it was just this hackathon project of a bunch of random tech people who thought, ‘hey, we can build a website, make some phone calls, maybe help some people find the vaccine at the margin.’”
* “We essentially ended up becoming the public-private partnership that was the clearinghouse for vaccine location information for the United States of America.”
* “People in tech need to become radically more skilled at interfacing with government. To the extent that we have some manifest competency issues in government right now, we can't simply sit out here and gripe about this on podcasts, etc. We've got to go out and do something about it.”
* “On the government side, one thing we need is dispelling the massive 'ugh' field that surrounds software.”
