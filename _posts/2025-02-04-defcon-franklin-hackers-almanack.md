[DEF CON Franklin](https://defconfranklin.com/) will host a luncheon event February 6 in Washington, D.C., for the inaugural release of *The Hackers' Almanack*.

"This report marks a historic moment for the DEF CON community," says DEF CON Franklin representatives. "It contains the most innovative and impactful findings from DEF CON 32, with an analysis of their policy implications."

Catered lunch and refreshments will be served. All attendees will receive a copy of the first *The Hackers' Almanack*.

Announced at DEF CON 2024, DEF CON Franklin aims to connect volunteers to "communities that are at gravest risk and least protected from growing attacks, such as water utilities and K-12 school districts."

The Almanack is a product of Franklin, a joint project of [DEF CON](https://defcon.org/) and the [University of Chicago, Cyber Policy Initiative](https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/harris-public-policy-announces-first-its-kind-cyber-policy-initiative).
