## FAQs

### What are the main principles outlined in the Declaration?

The Declaration outlines several key principles, including:



* Protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms online and across the digital ecosystem.
* Promoting a global Internet that advances the free flow of information.
* Advancing inclusive and affordable connectivity for all.
* Promoting trust in the global digital ecosystem, including through protection of privacy and personal data.
* Protecting and strengthening the multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance.


### Why was the Declaration created?

The Declaration was created in response to a growing concern about rising digital authoritarianism, where some states repress freedom of expression, censor independent news, interfere with elections, promote disinformation, and deny citizens fundamental human rights online. It also addresses issues like cybersecurity threats, lack of access, and the concentration of power within the Internet economy.


### Who are the partners involved in the Declaration?

The United States, along with over 60 partners from around the globe, launched the Declaration. These partners include numerous countries and the European Commission. The Declaration remains open to any government or relevant authority willing to commit to and implement its vision and principles.


### How does the Declaration address digital authoritarianism?

The Declaration is a direct response to concerns about digital authoritarianism. While it doesn't explicitly name specific countries, it affirms principles like freedom of expression, access to information, and the rejection of unlawful surveillance, which are in direct opposition to authoritarian practices. It promotes a vision where digital technologies reinforce, not weaken, democracy and respect for human rights.


### What is the "multi-stakeholder approach" to Internet governance, and why is it important?

The multi-stakeholder approach refers to a system where governments, academics, civil society, the private sector, the technical community, and other relevant parties collaborate in the development, deployment, and management of the Internet's technical protocols and related standards. This approach aims to prevent any single entity from controlling the Internet and ensures that it remains open, decentralized, and responsive to the needs of diverse users. It fosters a collaborative environment that is vital for maintaining the Internet's stability, security, and global interoperability.


### How will the Declaration be implemented and enforced?

The Declaration is not legally binding, so it does not have a formal enforcement mechanism. However, partner countries commit to translating its principles into concrete policies and actions within their own jurisdictions and to promoting these principles in existing multilateral forums such as the UN, G7, G20, OECD, and WTO. The effectiveness of the Declaration relies on the collective will of the partners to uphold and promote its vision.


### How does the Declaration relate to other international efforts and institutions focused on internet governance?

The Declaration explicitly takes into account and expects to contribute to existing processes within various international organizations, including the UN system, G7, G20, OECD, WTO, ICANN, and the Freedom Online Coalition. The goal is to fortify existing institutions by promoting the Declaration's principles within these frameworks. It's designed to be complementary to, rather than replace, these existing efforts, providing a unified vision for the future of the Internet.
