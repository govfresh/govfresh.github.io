## Summary

**Public AI is envisioned as a counterbalance to the current dominance of private companies in the AI sector.** The goal is to create AI infrastructure that prioritizes public benefit and is accessible, accountable, and sustainable in the long term.

This involves building:

* **Horizontal platforms** that provide access to essential resources like compute power and datasets,
* **Vertical platforms** that offer public options for AI-powered services, and
* **New public goods** like data commons for local knowledge and tools to address potential harms like bias.

A core concern is that the current trajectory, driven by commercial interests, could lead to an AI landscape that primarily serves those interests, neglecting broader societal needs. The development of public AI requires substantial funding, commitment to open-source principles, and active participation from various stakeholders, including governments, researchers, and the public. The urgency to act now stems from the need to shape a more equitable and trustworthy AI future before the market solidifies under a purely profit-driven model.

## FAQs

### What is Public AI?

Public AI is an ecosystem of publicly funded, developed, and governed AI initiatives designed to offer a counterbalance to the dominant private AI ecosystem. It encompasses a range of efforts focused on creating and distributing AI resources as public goods, ensuring broad accessibility, and prioritizing societal benefits. Public AI aims to build trust and resilience in the AI landscape by offering alternatives that prioritize public values and promote responsible AI development.

### Why do we need Public AI?

We need Public AI to address concerns about the current concentration of power in the private AI sector, where a few companies control most AI development and deployment. Public AI offers:

* **Trustworthy Alternatives:** Publicly governed AI systems can be designed with greater transparency and accountability, earning public trust and providing alternatives to commercially-driven AI applications.
* **Leveling the Playing Field:** Public AI initiatives can expand access to essential AI capabilities for individuals, researchers, and developers, fostering innovation and competition beyond the confines of large tech companies.
* **Strengthening Democracy:** Public AI can empower governments and citizens to shape the development of AI, ensuring it aligns with democratic values and addresses societal needs rather than solely focusing on profit maximization.

### How is Public AI different from private AI?

The key difference lies in ownership, control, and objectives:

* **Ownership and Control:** Public AI initiatives are funded, developed, and governed by public bodies, ensuring public oversight and control over AI resources. Private AI is controlled by corporations seeking to maximize profits.
* **Objectives:** Public AI prioritizes societal benefits, public values, and responsible AI development. Private AI primarily aims to generate profits and may not always prioritize broader societal concerns.

### What are the main features of Public AI?

* **Public Access:** Universally available, free or at-cost access to essential AI capabilities, ensuring inclusivity and democratizing access to AI.
* **Public Accountability:** Transparent and accountable governance structures with public oversight, fostering trust and ensuring responsible AI development.
* **Permanent Public Goods:** Sustainable funding and operational models that maintain the public nature of AI resources, fostering long-term stability and resilience in the AI ecosystem.

### What are some examples of Public AI initiatives?

* **Horizontal Platforms:** Provide public options in existing markets, such as public compute infrastructure like NAIRR and EmpireAI, and public datasets like AI2â€™s Dolma and Mozilla's Common Voice.
* **Vertical Platforms:** Public utilities focused on delivering reliable and high-quality AI services, similar to the US Postal Service, with a focus on user needs and public interest objectives.
* **New Public Goods:** Address underserved problems of public importance, such as AI-powered public tutoring systems, medical diagnosis assistance, or hyperlocal weather prediction models.

### What are the potential benefits of Public AI?

* **Expanding Access:** Making AI tools and resources available to a broader audience, fostering innovation and empowering individuals and communities.
* **Leveling the Playing Field:** Reducing reliance on private companies, promoting competition, and creating opportunities for a more diverse range of AI applications.
* **Driving Public Value:** Focusing on societal challenges and delivering tangible benefits to the public, prioritizing areas like healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability.
* **Strengthening Democracy:** Empowering citizens and governments to shape the development of AI, ensuring it serves the public good and aligns with democratic values.

### What are the challenges in developing Public AI?

* **Funding:** Securing sufficient and sustainable public funding to support research, development, and maintenance of public AI initiatives.
* **Governance:** Establishing effective governance structures that ensure transparency, accountability, and public participation in decision-making processes.
* **Collaboration:** Fostering collaboration between governments, research institutions, civil society organizations, and private sector actors.
* **Technical Expertise:** Building capacity and attracting technical talent to develop and maintain state-of-the-art public AI systems.

### How can I get involved in Public AI?

* **Support Public AI Initiatives:** Advocate for public funding and policies that support public AI development.
* **Contribute to Open Source Projects:** Participate in open source AI projects, contribute code, data, or expertise.
* **Engage in Public Discourse:** Raise awareness about the importance of public AI, discuss its potential benefits and challenges, and participate in public consultations.
* **Join Organizations:** Support organizations working on Public AI, such as the Public AI Network, Mozilla Foundation, and AI Now Institute.
