# Spinner

**Full documentation:** https://webawesome.com/docs/components/spinner


`<wa-spinner>` Stable Since 2.0

Spinners indicate that an operation is in progress when the duration is unknown. Use them for loading states where a determinate progress bar isn't practical.

```html
<wa-spinner></wa-spinner>
```

## Examples

### Size

Spinners are sized based on the current font size. To change their size, set the `font-size` property on the spinner itself or on a parent element as shown below.

```html
<wa-spinner></wa-spinner>
<wa-spinner style="font-size: 2rem;"></wa-spinner>
<wa-spinner style="font-size: 3rem;"></wa-spinner>
```

### Track Width

The width of the spinner's track can be changed by setting the `--track-width` custom property.

```html
<wa-spinner style="font-size: 50px; --track-width: 10px;"></wa-spinner>
```

### Color

The spinner's colors can be changed by setting the `--indicator-color` and `--track-color` custom properties.

```html
<wa-spinner style="font-size: 3rem; --indicator-color: deeppink; --track-color: pink;"></wa-spinner>
```
